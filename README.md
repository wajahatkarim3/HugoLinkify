# Why?

I wanted to add links in my Hugo website as a preview card seen in Medium.com articles. Since my website is developed in Hugo, so I created a Shortcode to render the links. But I had to manually put the meta data of any URL such as Title, Description, Thumbnail Image URL etc. This was too boring and time consuming, so I created this tool Hugo Linkify, which lets you create the Shortcode template code from any URL. All you have to do is copy the result code and paste it in your Hugo sites and enjoy the Medium like cards in your site.
